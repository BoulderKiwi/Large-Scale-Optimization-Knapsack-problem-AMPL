## Large Scale Optimization Term paper with AMPL: University of Colorado at Denver

I used A Mathematical Programming Language (_AMPL_) to solve several multiple knapsack problems. AMPL is an algebraic modeling language that is used to describe and solve high-complexity problems for large-scale mathematical computing. I used both CPLEX and Gurobi solvers to compare run times and results. AMPL code is included at the end of the PDF. 
The application of techniques discussed in the paper have been used to improve decisions for allocating limited resources, investments in a portfolio and storage of data files.
