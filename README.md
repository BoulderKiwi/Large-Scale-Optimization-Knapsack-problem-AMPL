# Large Scale Optimization with AMPL: Final Project Colorado University 

For this report, I used A Mathematical Programming LanguageÂ (AMPL) to solve multiple knapsack problems. AMPL is an algebraic modeling language to describe and solve high-complexity problems for large-scale mathematical computing.  The applications of the techniques in this paper can be used in decision making for finding the least wasteful way to use resources, select portfolio investments and store files most efficiently in storage devices. I used both CPLEX and Gurobi solvers to compare run times and results. AMPL code is included with the PDF.
